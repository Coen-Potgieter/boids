This project is an implementation of an artificial life program: The Boids algorithm, which models the flocking behavior of birds, fish, and other swarming creatures. The simulation is built using **C++** and **SFML** to create an interactive and visually appealing (in my humble opinion) flocking system.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

I will not subject you to a poor man's explanation of this algorithm works, instead I will refer you to the explanations linked in the Contributions section. 
With that said, here is the TL;DR: While this flocking behavior may seem complex at first, it is deceptively simple and emerges from just three basic rules:

1. **Separation** ‚Äì Boids steer away from nearby flockmates to avoid collisions.
2. **Alignment** ‚Äì Boids adjust their velocity to match the average direction of neighbors.
3. **Cohesion** ‚Äì Boids move toward the average position of nearby flockmates.

By combining these rules, realistic swarm-like behavior emerges. Additionally, I‚Äôve introduced the mouse position as a sort of "Predator." The Boids will actively avoid the mouse as they fly around, adding another layer of interaction to the simulation.

## Features üöÄ

- Real-time visualization of Boids movement
- Configurable parameters for tuning flocking behavior
- Object-oriented architecture for modularity and scalability
- Smooth animations with SFML's graphics rendering

3. Ensure You Have The **CMake** Installed:

    - Using Homebrew
        ```bash
        brew install cmake
        ```

    - Using ATP

        ```

### Build & Run

1. **Build The Project**:
    - In the root directory run:
        ```bash
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
        make
        ```

2. **Run The Application**
    - Simply Execute:
        ```bash
        ./bin/main
        ```
